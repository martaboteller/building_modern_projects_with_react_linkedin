## About the project

I've followed this LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-modern-projects-with-react/react-going-from-good-to-great?autoplay=true">course</a> offered by Shaun Wassell.
We've learned the most important tools in the React ecosystem that help simplify development and manage the complexities of state, side effects, structure, and styling. The project includes Redux, thunks, selectors, styled-components and tests.

I am on my way to achieve a fullstack overview, here's why -> :rocket: [go fullstack!](https://martaboteller.com/fullstack)
